# Project 2 WAID

## Testing
* To run the entire test suite: `python test.py`
* To run a single test file (eg. `test/initiative.py`): `python -m unittest test.initiative`

##Creating an Executable File
* First, install pyinstaller into the directory where pip is located
* Then run: 'pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole app.py' in the terminal
* Add a copy of current assets folder into the folder with the new 'app.exe'
* 'app.exe' should run smoothly. Folder could be zipped to save space
